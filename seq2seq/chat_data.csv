Tell me about Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple,"Located in central Sri Lanka, the Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple <cUd7ZThLR61KyzvL2dJq> is a living Buddhist site that is focused on a series of five cave shrines. Inhabited by forest-dwelling Buddhist monks since the 3rd century BCE, these natural caves have been transformed continuously throughout the historical period into one of the largest and most outstanding Buddhist complexes in the Southern and South Eastern Asian region, showcasing innovative approaches to interior layout and decoration. In keeping with a longstanding tradition associated with living Buddhist ritual practices and continuous royal patronage, the cave shrines underwent several renovation and refurbishing programs before assuming their present interior forms in the 18th century. The vast internal spaces of the cave shrines are not compartmentalized, but are spatially differentiated by a deliberate and subtle arrangement of polychrome sculpture of exceptional craftsmanship and decorated with brilliant compositions of mural paintings. This spatial hierarchy and purposive interior layout devoid of physical divisions lead the devotees systematically through the spaces from one ritual function to the next. The site is remarkable in the Buddhist world for its association with the continuous tradition of living Buddhist ritual practices and pilgrimage for more than two millennia."

Tell me about Narangala Mountain,"Narangala <dS9jN701iUYTIuxjddNw> is a picturesque and magnificent mountain situated in the Badulla district of Uva province. The beautiful Narangala Mountain rises up to about 1527 meters and is the second-highest mountain in the Uva province. The hill is unique in two ways. First, it has two parts: one is a rectangular-shaped plateau, and the other one is a triangular-shaped peak. The other speciality is the location of Narangala Mountain. It is located at the edge of Uva while pointing out towards a gap formed between the valleys of Uma Oya, Badulu Oya and Loggal Oya. This gap opens up a comprehensive view of the Mahaweli flood plains, which extend up to Trincomalee. The hiking trail starts at the Thangamalai estate area. You should stop your vehicle at the Hindu temple in the estate. Go along the foot trails of the estate until you find a large pipeline which supplies water to the tea estate. Follow the pipe until the point that it reaches a road that runs through the estate. After following the estate road for a while, you will get to the point where you start climbing the mountain. The first part of the climb will be through a grove of turpentine trees. This path is very slippery because of the leaves which fall from the trees."
